   Welcome to Rome in the year 85 AD. The empire is expanding rapidly and with it, Roman wealth, infrastructure and culture are introduced to the masses of Europe. Entertainment is an integral part of this culture and one of the most popular forms of entertainment is gladiatorial battle. Hundreds of ampitheaters, both small and large, are built all over the empire to stage executions, beast hunts and gladiatorial fights.
