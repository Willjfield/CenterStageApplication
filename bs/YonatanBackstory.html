    Yonatan was born in the city of Jaffa in the kingdom of Judea. Judea was part of the Roman Empire but had enjoyed a certain amount of autonomy. As Yonatan grew up, he saw tensions rise between Jews and Roman rulers who were increasingly restricting Jewish autonomy and even began looting Jewish holy sites. Yonatan saw many of his family members take up arms and riot against the unjust conditions.Yonatan learned from an early age that the only way to defend freedom was by force. He was told stories of brave Jewish warriors who had become famous battling Roman soldiers.

    When Yonatan was 12, his father was killed by Romans so he fled with his Mother to Jerusalem. Yonatan was brave but when the Romans laid seige to Jerusalem and the Jewish zealots ruined any hopes for negotiation.

    Eventually, the Romans sacked Jerusalem. They slaughtered thousands of inhabitants and destroyed everything that was sacred to the Jews. Yonatan was captured by Romans. He was too young to be executed so they sold him into slavery. He felt lucky to be alive but ashamed that he had not died fighting for his peoples freedom.

    A Roman aristocrat, seeing Yonatan's health and vigor, offered to buy him and train him as a gladiator. Yonatan was enrolled in gladiator school in Rome at the age of 16. He knew he would never see his family again. He had lost everything and he wanted to fight.
